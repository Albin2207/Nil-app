# 🔥 Firestore Rules - Hybrid Mode (Manual + User Uploads)

## 🎯 **Current Setup: Supports Both**

Your Firestore rules now support:
- ✅ **Manual uploads** (Firebase Console, no auth)
- ✅ **User uploads** (via app, with auth)

---

## 📋 **Current Rules Summary:**

### **Videos & Shorts:**
- ✅ **Read:** Anyone (auth not required)
- ✅ **Create:** Anyone (supports manual uploads)
- ✅ **Update:** Anyone (for likes, views, comments)
- ✅ **Delete:** Anyone (open for now)

### **Comments:**
- ✅ **Read:** Anyone
- ✅ **Create:** Anyone
- ✅ **Update:** Anyone (likes/dislikes)
- ✅ **Delete:** Anyone

### **Users:**
- ✅ **Read:** Anyone
- ✅ **Create:** Only the user themselves
- ✅ **Update/Delete:** Only the user themselves

---

## 🔐 **Later: When Upload Feature is Ready**

When you implement the upload screen, we'll tighten rules to:

```javascript
// Videos & Shorts (Future - More Secure)
match /videos/{videoId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if true; // Still allow manual
  allow update: if true; // For likes/views
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
    (
      !resource.data.keys().hasAny(['uploadedBy']) || // Manual uploads
      request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy    // User owns it
    );
}
```

## ✅ **Benefits of Current Setup:**

1. **Backward Compatible:**
   - Old manually uploaded videos/shorts work
   - Likes, comments, views all work
   
2. **Forward Compatible:**
   - New user uploads will include `uploadedBy` field
   - Can distinguish between manual vs user uploads
   
3. **Flexible:**
   - Supports both workflows
   - Easy to tighten security later

## 🚀 **What Works Now:**

✅ Manual uploads from Firebase Console  
✅ User uploads from app (when implemented)  
✅ Likes/dislikes on all content  
✅ Comments on all content  
✅ Comment deletion  
✅ View count increment  
✅ Share functionality
