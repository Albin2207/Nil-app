### 1. Run the App

### 2. Add Videos to Firestore

Since you're adding videos manually, follow the structure in `FIREBASE_DATA_STRUCTURE.md`.

#### Quick Example:

Go to your Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí `videos` collection:

```
Document ID: (auto-generated)

Fields:
- title: "Amazing Video Title"
- description: "This is a great video about..."
- videoUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/v123/video.mp4"
- thumbnailUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v123/thumb.jpg"
- channelName: "Your Channel"
- channelAvatar: "https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=5"
- duration: 300 (in seconds, e.g., 300 = 5 minutes)
- views: 0
- likes: 0
- dislikes: 0
- subscribers: 1000
- timestamp: [Server Timestamp - click the clock icon]
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Make sure `duration`, `views`, `likes`, `dislikes`, and `subscribers` are **Number** type, not String!
- Use the Firebase timestamp (clock icon) for the `timestamp` field
- Your Cloudinary video URLs should be publicly accessible

### 3. Verify Cloudinary URLs

Make sure your Cloudinary video is:
1. Uploaded and public
2. The URL is a direct video URL (ends with .mp4, .mov, etc.)
3. Accessible from a browser

Example valid URL:
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/video/upload/v1234567890/sample.mp4
```

### 4. Test the Features

#### Test Like/Dislike:
1. Open a video
2. Click the like button ‚Üí it should turn red and count should increase
3. Click again ‚Üí it should turn grey and count should decrease
4. Try the dislike button ‚Üí like should auto-remove

#### Test Comments:
1. Scroll down to the comment section
2. Type a comment
3. Press the send button or Enter
4. Comment should appear instantly with "Just now" timestamp

#### Test Related Videos:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the video page
2. See recommended videos
3. Click on any video ‚Üí it should navigate to that video

#### Test Persistence:
1. Like a video
2. Close the app
3. Reopen the app and navigate to the same video
4. The like should still be active (red)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Video Not Playing?

2. Try opening the URL in a browser
3. Make sure it's a direct video file URL, not a webpage
4. Check your internet connection

### Likes/Dislikes Not Working?
1. Make sure you deployed the Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí videos ‚Üí your video document has `likes` and `dislikes` fields as numbers
3. Check console for errors

### Comments Not Showing?
1. Make sure Firestore rules allow comments (already deployed)
2. Comments are in a subcollection: `videos/{videoId}/comments`
3. Check Firebase Console to verify comments are being created

### Related Videos Not Showing?
1. Make sure you have multiple videos in your Firestore `videos` collection
2. Each video needs proper fields (title, thumbnailUrl, etc.)

## üé® Customization

### Change App Name:
The app displays "NilStream" in the home screen. To change it, edit:
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` ‚Üí Line 33

### Change Color Scheme:
The app uses YouTube's red (#FF0000) as the accent color. To change:
- Search for `Colors.red` in `video_playing_screen.dart`
- Replace with your preferred color

### Add User Authentication:
Currently, comments show "Anonymous User". To add real users:
1. Add Firebase Authentication package
2. Replace `'Anonymous User'` with actual user data
3. Update Firestore rules to require authentication

## üìù Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Add Firebase Authentication**: Let users sign in
2. **User Profiles**: Display real user names and avatars
3. **Video Upload Feature**: Let users upload videos from the app
4. **Playlists**: Create and manage playlists
5. **Search Functionality**: Search videos by title
6. **Video Quality Selection**: Let users choose video quality
7. **Download Feature**: Actually download videos for offline viewing
8. **Notifications**: Notify users about new videos from subscribed channels

### Admin Panel Ideas:
Consider creating a web admin panel using:
- Flutter Web
- React + Firebase
- Firebase Console (manual for now is fine)

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No User Authentication**: Everyone is "Anonymous User"
2. **No Admin Panel**: Videos must be added manually via Firebase Console
3. **Basic Video Player**: Chewie is good but not as advanced as YouTube's player
4. **No Video Upload**: Must upload to Cloudinary manually
5. **No Real Subscribe Feature**: Subscribe button is just a toggle (not connected to anything yet)

## üí° Tips

- Keep your Firestore rules secure in production
- Consider adding video upload limits
- Add error handling for network failures
- Implement video caching for better performance
- Add analytics to track user behavior

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Firebase Console for errors
2. Look at the Flutter debug console
3. Verify your Firestore data structure matches the guide
4. Make sure all packages are installed: `flutter pub get`
