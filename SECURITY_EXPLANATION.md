# 🔒 Security Rules - How They Work

## 🎯 **Your Question: Can Toni Delete James's Content?**

### **With NEW Rules: NO! ✅**

James signs up and:
- Comments on a video → `userId: james_uid`
- Uploads a video → `uploadedBy: james_uid`

Toni signs up and tries to:
- ❌ **Delete James's comment** → BLOCKED (userId != toni_uid)
- ❌ **Delete James's video** → BLOCKED (uploadedBy != toni_uid)
- ✅ **Like/unlike James's video** → ALLOWED (update likes count)
- ✅ **Comment on James's video** → ALLOWED (create comment)

---

## 🔐 **How the Rules Work:**

### **Videos & Shorts Deletion:**
```javascript
allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
  (!resource.data.keys().hasAny(['uploadedBy']) ||  // Case 1: Manual upload
   request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy);   // Case 2: User upload
```

**What This Means:**

**Case 1: Manual Upload (No `uploadedBy` field)**
- Old videos/shorts you added manually
- ANY authenticated user can delete (not ideal, but necessary for manual management)
- Solution: Add `uploadedBy: "admin"` to manual uploads if you want to protect them

**Case 2: User Upload (Has `uploadedBy` field)**
- Videos/shorts uploaded by users from app
- **ONLY the owner** (uploadedBy == user's uid) can delete
- ✅ **James's video** → Only James can delete
- ❌ **Toni cannot delete** James's video

---

### **Comments Deletion:**
```javascript
allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
  (!resource.data.keys().hasAny(['userId']) ||  // Case 1: Old comment
   request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId);   // Case 2: New comment
```

**What This Means:**

**Case 1: Old Comments (No `userId` field)**
- Comments created before auth implementation
- ANY authenticated user can delete (temporary, for cleanup)

**Case 2: New Comments (Has `userId` field)**
- Comments created after auth implementation
- **ONLY the comment owner** can delete
- ✅ **James's comment** → Only James can delete
- ❌ **Toni cannot delete** James's comment

---

## ✅ **What's Protected:**

### **User Content:**
✅ James's videos → Only James can delete  
✅ James's shorts → Only James can delete  
✅ James's comments → Only James can delete  
✅ James's profile → Only James can edit  

### **What Everyone Can Do:**
✅ Read all videos/shorts/comments  
✅ Like/dislike videos/shorts  
✅ Create their own comments  
✅ Update like counts (not the content itself)  

---

## 🛡️ **Security Levels:**

### **Level 1: READ (Public)**
- ✅ Anyone can read
- No authentication required
- Videos, shorts, comments visible to all

### **Level 2: UPDATE (Limited)**
- ✅ Anyone can update likes, views, counts
- Cannot update title, description, video URL
- Only increments/decrements allowed

### **Level 3: CREATE (Open for Now)**
- ✅ Anyone can create
- Supports manual uploads
- Will add userId automatically for logged-in users

### **Level 4: DELETE (Owner Only)**
- ✅ If content has userId/uploadedBy → **Only owner**
- ⚠️ If content has NO userId/uploadedBy → Any auth user (for manual content management)

---

## 🔧 **Better Protection for Manual Uploads:**

### **Option 1: Add Admin Field**
When manually uploading, add:
```json
{
  "uploadedBy": "admin",
  // ... other fields
}
```

Then rule becomes:
- Only users with uid == "admin" can delete manual uploads

### **Option 2: Mark as Protected**
```json
{
  "isManualUpload": true,
  // ... other fields
}
```

Update rule:
```javascript
allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
  (!resource.data.isManualUpload && // Don't allow deletion of manual uploads
   request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy);
```

## 📊 **Scenarios:**

### **Scenario 1: James Uploads Video**
```
Video created with: { uploadedBy: "james_uid", ... }
James tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (owner)
Toni tries to delete → ❌ DENIED (not owner)
```

### **Scenario 2: Manual Video Upload**
```
Video created with: { /* no uploadedBy field */ }
James tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (any auth user)
Toni tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (any auth user)
```

### **Scenario 3: James Comments**
```
Comment created with: { userId: "james_uid", ... }
James tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (owner)
Toni tries to delete → ❌ DENIED (not owner)
```

### **Scenario 4: Old Comment (No userId)**
```
Comment created with: { /* no userId field */ }
James tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (any auth user)
Toni tries to delete → ✅ ALLOWED (any auth user)
```

---

## 🎯 **Summary:**

### **Current Protection:**
✅ **User-uploaded content** → Protected (only owner can delete)  
⚠️ **Manual content** → Any authenticated user can delete (necessary for flexibility)  
✅ **Likes/Views** → Anyone can update counts  
❌ **Content itself** → Cannot be edited by others  

### **Recommendation:**
When you manually upload videos/shorts, add:
```json
"uploadedBy": "your_admin_uid_here"
```

This way manual uploads are also protected!

**The rules are now balanced between flexibility and security!** 🔐
