# Quick Deep Link Test ðŸ§ª

## The Problem
The Netlify page loads but doesn't open the app. Let's debug this step by step.

## Step 1: Test Direct App Link First

Let's test if the app can handle deep links at all:

1. **Open your app** (make sure it's running)
2. **Add this test button** to any screen temporarily:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Test opening a video via deep link
    Navigator.pushNamed(context, 'nilstream://video/TEST123');
  },
  child: Text('Test Deep Link'),
)
```

3. **Tap the button** - if it works, the deep link system is working
4. **Check console** for the debug messages we added

## Step 2: Test Netlify Link

If Step 1 works, then test the Netlify link:

1. **Open browser** on your phone
2. **Type**: `https://nilapp-links.netlify.app/video?id=TEST123`
3. **Press Enter**
4. **Check if app opens**

## Step 3: Debug Netlify Page

If Step 2 doesn't work, the issue is in the Netlify page. Let's add debug info:

**Update `nilapp_links/index.html`** - add this after line 103:

```javascript
console.log('ðŸŽ¬ Attempting to open app with scheme:', appScheme);
console.log('ðŸ“± Video ID:', videoId);
```

Then test again and check browser console.

## Step 4: Alternative Approach

If nothing works, let's try a simpler approach:

**Update the Netlify page** to use a different method:

```javascript
// Replace the current app opening code with:
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = appScheme;
link.click();
```

## Most Likely Issues:

1. **App not properly registered** - Need to rebuild and reinstall
2. **Netlify page timing** - The redirect happens too fast
3. **Browser blocking** - Some browsers block custom schemes

## Quick Fix Test:

Try this URL in your phone's browser:
`https://nilapp-links.netlify.app/video?id=TEST123`

If you see the loading screen but app doesn't open, the issue is the app registration.
If you don't see the loading screen, the issue is the Netlify page.
