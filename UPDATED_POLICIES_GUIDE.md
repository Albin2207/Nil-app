```

### Step 2: Host the Account Deletion Page

2. Upload `account_deletion.html`

## ðŸ“§ Handling Deletion Requests

### Manual Process (Email-Based):

When you receive a deletion request email:

1. **Verify the user**
   - Confirm email matches a user in Firebase

2. **Delete from Firebase**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase Console or via script:
   // 1. Delete user's videos from 'videos' collection
   // 2. Delete user's shorts from 'shorts' collection
   // 3. Delete user's comments from all videos/shorts
   // 4. Delete user's subscriptions from 'subscriptions' collection
   // 5. Delete user from 'users' collection
   // 6. Delete user from Firebase Authentication
   ```

3. **Delete from Cloudinary**
   - Delete user's uploaded videos/thumbnails

4. **Send confirmation email**
   - Notify user that account is deleted

### Automated Process (Recommended):

Create a Firebase Cloud Function:

```javascript
exports.deleteUserAccount = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const { userId } = data;
  
  // Delete user data from Firestore
  await deleteUserData(userId);
  
  // Delete from Authentication
  await admin.auth().deleteUser(userId);
  
  // Delete from Cloudinary
  await deleteCloudinaryContent(userId);
  
  return { success: true };
});
```
