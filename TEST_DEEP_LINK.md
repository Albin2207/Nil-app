# Testing Deep Links - Fixed Version 🚀

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Added HTTPS intent filter** to `AndroidManifest.xml`
2. **Simplified redirect logic** in Netlify page (immediate app opening)
3. **Faster timeout** (1.5 seconds instead of 2)

## 📱 How to Test (After Rebuild)

### Step 1: Rebuild Your App
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Step 2: Test the Flow

**Option A: Direct App Link Test**
1. Open terminal/CMD
2. Run this command (replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with actual video ID):
```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "nilstream://video/YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
```

**Option B: Full Flow Test**
1. Open any video in your app
2. Share it (use share button)
3. Copy the link: `https://nilapp-links.netlify.app/video?id=xxx`
4. Open this link in your browser
5. **The Netlify page should immediately try to open your app!**

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### If App is Installed:
1. Netlify page loads (shows spinner)
2. **Within 1 second**: Your app opens to the video
3. Browser closes/moves to background

### If App is NOT Installed:
1. Netlify page loads
2. After 1.5 seconds: Shows "NIL App Not Found" + Download buttons

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If app still doesn't open:
1. **Rebuild the app** - Very important! The manifest changes need a full rebuild
2. **Uninstall and reinstall** the app to ensure proper registration
3. **Clear browser cache** before testing again

### To verify app is registered for deep links:
```bash
adb shell pm resolve-activity --brief -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d nilstream://video/test
```

If it shows your app's package name, it's working!

## 🎯 Next Steps After Successful Test

1. **Update download links** in `nilapp_links/index.html`:
   - Line 140: Replace with actual Play Store URL
   - Line 141: Replace with actual App Store URL

2. **Optional: Add custom domain** on Netlify for cleaner URLs

3. **Test on real devices** to ensure it works in production
