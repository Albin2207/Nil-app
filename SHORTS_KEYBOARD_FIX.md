# ⌨️ Shorts Comments - Keyboard Issues Fixed

## 🐛 **Issues That Were Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Input Field Hidden Behind Keyboard**
- When keyboard appeared, comment input field was hidden
- User couldn't see what they were typing
- Input field stayed at bottom behind keyboard

### **Problem 2: Focus Issues**
- Keyboard didn't dismiss properly after posting
- TextField focus management was inconsistent
- Dialog didn't adapt to keyboard height

---

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Comments Bottom Sheet - Keyboard Responsiveness**

#### **Added Dynamic Padding:**
```dart
final keyboardHeight = MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom;

return Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.only(bottom: keyboardHeight),
  child: Container(...)
);
```
✅ Sheet now moves up with keyboard  
✅ Input field always visible  
✅ Responsive to keyboard height  

#### **Improved TextField:**
```dart
TextField(
  maxLines: 4,
  minLines: 1,
  textInputAction: TextInputAction.send,
  onSubmitted: (_) {
    _postComment();
    FocusScope.of(context).unfocus();  // Dismiss keyboard
  },
)
```
✅ Multiline support (1-4 lines)  
✅ Enter key sends comment  
✅ Auto-dismisses keyboard after posting  

#### **Better Focus Management:**
```dart
IconButton(
  onPressed: () {
    _postComment();
    FocusScope.of(context).unfocus();  // Always dismiss
  },
  icon: const Icon(Icons.send),
)
```
✅ Keyboard dismisses on send button tap  
✅ No hanging keyboard issues  

#### **Enhanced Modal Bottom Sheet:**
```dart
showModalBottomSheet(
  isScrollControlled: true,   // Full control
  isDismissible: true,        // Can dismiss by tapping outside
  enableDrag: true,           // Can drag to close
  backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
  ...
)
```
✅ Better user control  
✅ Smooth animations  
✅ Native feel

### **2. Reply Dialog - Keyboard Adaptation**

#### **Added Scrollable Content:**
```dart
AlertDialog(
  insetPadding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 24),
  content: SingleChildScrollView(
    child: Column(...)
  ),
)
```
✅ Dialog scrolls if keyboard takes too much space  
✅ Content always accessible  
✅ Works on all screen sizes  

#### **Improved TextField:**
```dart
TextField(
  maxLines: 4,
  minLines: 3,
  textInputAction: TextInputAction.send,
  onSubmitted: (_) => _postReply(),
  ...
)
```
✅ Enter key posts reply  
✅ Multiline support  
✅ Better typing experience
