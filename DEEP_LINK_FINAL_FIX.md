# Deep Link Final Fix Instructions ðŸš€

## The Issue
Modern browsers block custom schemes (`nilstream://`) for security. We need **App Links** which use HTTPS URLs.

## What I Just Did

1. âœ… Added `android:autoVerify="true"` to the HTTPS intent filter
2. âœ… Created `.well-known/assetlinks.json` for App Links verification
3. âœ… Updated `main.dart` to better handle HTTPS links
4. âœ… Removed test button from home screen

## NEXT STEPS (IMPORTANT!)

### 1. Get Your SHA256 Fingerprint
Run this command to get your app's certificate fingerprint:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore android/app/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

Look for **SHA256** fingerprint (something like: `AB:CD:EF:...`)

### 2. Update assetlinks.json
Replace `YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT_HERE` in `nilapp_links/.well-known/assetlinks.json` with your actual fingerprint.

### 3. Deploy to Netlify
Drag and drop the `nilapp_links` folder to Netlify

### 4. **CRITICAL: Rebuild Your App**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

The app MUST be rebuilt after manifest changes!

### 5. Test the Link
Go to: `https://nilapp-links.netlify.app/video?id=TEST123`

## Why This Should Work

- **App Links** (https://) are supported by all modern browsers
- Android verifies the domain ownership via assetlinks.json
- No more custom scheme blocking!

## Alternative: If You Want to Skip App Links

Just use the Netlify link as a **landing page** that opens the app via Intent URLs. The link won't be "clickable" in browsers, but will work when shared.

**Let me know when you've completed step 1 (getting the fingerprint)!**
