## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

### **Firestore Queries**

- Ordered by timestamp: `.orderBy('timestamp', descending: true)`

### **Account Deletion**

- **Complete**: Auth + Firestore + all content

## 📊 Real-Time Stats

The profile header shows **live counts** from Firestore user document:
- **Videos Count**: `uploadedVideosCount`
- **Shorts Count**: `uploadedShortsCount`

These stats update automatically when the user uploads or deletes content.
